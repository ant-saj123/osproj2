April 7 - 1:49 PM - Day 1

For the first session, I first made sure that I understand all of the project requirements correctly. Then,
I set up the initial threading structure for the bank simulation project. 
I've created basic threads representing the tellers, initializing their readiness states, 
and implemented a simple loop to simulate them being available to serve customers. 
At this stage, each teller prints messages indicating their readiness and waiting state. 
Going forward, I'll introduce customers and manage their interactions with tellers.
